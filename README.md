Collections of scripting stuff I wrote for Foundry's Katana software.

## License

If no LICENSE.md file is clearly specified for a script, OR the _top docstring_ 
doesn't define a License,
 the script is by default shared under `Creative Commons Attribution

## Utilisation

You can have a look at the  `README.md` file in each folder.

Else each script should always have a top docstring for documentation.



## What's Inside

- viewer
    - `LightViewerAnnotate` : 

       Annotate (& color) lights in the viewer using their attributes.

    - `PointcloudWidth`: 

      Add a `geometry.point.width` attribute to control the size of the points in the viewer.


- instancing

  - `PointcloudXform2P`

    Allow merging xform transformations on a pointcloud location to the `geometry.point.P` attribute.
