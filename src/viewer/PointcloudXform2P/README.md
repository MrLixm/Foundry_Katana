## Installation

### .lua

Create a new OpScript node and copy/paste the content of the .lua script inside.
Follow the instructions on the top comment to config the node.

## Guide

> âš  If your `xform` is interactive, you need to disable this Op before trying to
move it in the viewer as the xform attribute is deleted.

If the locations matched by CEL doesn't have a `geometry.point.P` it will yield
an error so check your CEL.
